# garden_2022_stats

This simulation is about Transformice's [Garden Event 2022](https://transformice.fandom.com/wiki/Vegetable_Garden_2022#Seeds).

It computes, for different strategies, how many turns it takes in average to grow a chili pepper.

# Results

```
Only planting mystery or     TOMATO or better:	299.53 turns
Only planting mystery or  BLUEBERRY or better:	250.46 turns
Only planting mystery or      GRAPE or better:	242.78 turns
Only planting mystery or      LEMON or better:	255.43 turns
Only planting mystery or     PEPPER or better:	334.98 turns
Only planting mystery or    NOTHING or better:	466.53 turns
```

# Conclusion

It is better to plant a mystery seed, rather than planting a tomato or blueberry seed.
Only plant grape seeds or better to optimize the speed at which you get chili peppers.

NOTE: blueberries give 3 cheese each, so if what you want is cheese and not chili peppers, it is still worth planting it.
Chili peppers are worth 30 cheese for the NPCs.
